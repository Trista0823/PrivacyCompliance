# PrivacyCompliance
Here is the github for the paper "Automated Compliance Checking for Chinese Privacy Policy: A New Task and Dataset". We share our dataset for Chinese privacy policy compliance checking from both document level and fine-grained level annotations.

Currently, our pretrained model ComplianceBERT is going through the companyâ€™s data disclosure approval process, and we will update our model once the approval is passed.
